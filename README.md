shopping app connecting buyers and sellers
This app is based on the idea of choice of users and not shoppers.
users will be able to choose their items from the shops they want and will get it delivered.
Not like other shopping apps where user has no idea from where the packet will be shipped and have to pay for delivery charges.
Working to extend it to offer food and grocery delivery also.
